**1. Project Name:** 

Aligning Mysterious Reads

**2. Project repository:**
https://github.com/umms-hackathon/mystalign

**3. Team members:**

**4. Aim:** 

Small RNAs makes a significant portion of RNAs in a cell,
responsible for various tasks. However, 5% to 20% of small RNA
reads cannot be directly mapped to the genome. Aim of the
project is to find the sources of these unaligned reads.

**5. Project description:**

First phase of the project requires alignment of given FASTQ
reads to the genome and find ones that cannot be aligned.
Second phase is to find the sources of these reads. Possible
reasons of having non-aligned sequences might be
modifications, mutations, missing genome parts, etc. Third phase
is applying the same rules to other test data in order to increase
the alignment success.

**6. Supporting material and links:**

smallRNA FASTQ data will be supplied during the Hackathon.
